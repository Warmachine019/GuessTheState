# GuessTheState
A game to guess the states in America in python.
Uses the "pandas" library to find data in the csv file and turtles.
Type in the state you guessed in the popup window and it appears on the political map of the country.
The states not guessed are stored in a file which the user can review after the program execution ends.
"exit" is the code to be typed in the popup window in order to stop peogram execution and generate a file with the missed states.
